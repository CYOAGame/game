# Landing Page + OAuth Removal

**Date:** 2026-04-13
**Status:** Design approved, ready for implementation planning

## Problem

The game currently opens to a `/login` page that asks for GitHub credentials
before the player can do anything. This is wrong for two reasons:

1. Most players don't need GitHub at all — invited players arrive via an
   invite link that already contains the token, and offline players need
   nothing. Only world *hosts* (who fork the template and manage invites)
   need a GitHub PAT.
2. There's no page that explains what the game is. A stranger who discovers
   the URL sees "Connect to GitHub to save your world" — meaningless without
   context.

## Goals

- Replace the root route (`/`) with a landing page that explains what
  Journal RPG is, offers zero-friction entry points, and teaches hosts how
  to set up their own world.
- Remove GitHub OAuth entirely — the OAuth worker, the GitHub App
  registration, the env vars, and all related code. The only auth model is
  fine-grained PATs (for hosts) and invite codes (for players).
- Rename the PAT wizard from `/login/pat-wizard` to `/setup` to reflect
  that it's a host setup flow, not a login.
- Update expired-token redirects to branch on `authMethod`: hosts go to
  `/setup?error=expired`, invited players go to `/` with a "your invite
  expired" message.

## Auth model after this change

| User | Entry point | Auth mechanism | GitHub account needed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Curious stranger | Landing page → Play Offline | None | No |
| Invited player | Invite link → `/invite?code=...` | Token embedded in the link | No |
| World host | Landing page → fork + PAT → `/setup` | Fine-grained PAT they create once | Yes |

There is no "login" concept. The `/login` route is deleted.

## Landing page structure (`/`)

Single scrollable page. Replaces the current `src/routes/+page.svelte`
which does an auth-check redirect.

### Section 1: Hero

- Title: "Journal RPG"
- Tagline: one line that captures the pitch (e.g., *"A choose-your-own-
  adventure game backed by git"* — Joe can wordsmith later)
- Uses the existing dark aesthetic (`--session-end-bg`, `--journal-accent`)

### Section 2: What is it

2-3 sentences:
- Interactive fiction where your choices shape a persistent world
- Progress saves as git commits
- Play solo offline or in a shared world with friends

### Section 3: Try it now

Two side-by-side CTAs:

1. **Play Offline** — links to `/?offline=true` (existing flow, works
   today, zero friction)
2. **Join the Public World** — links to
   `{base}/invite?code=${PUBLIC_GAME_INVITE_CODE}` where the code is read
   from `$env/static/public`. The code value is stored as a GitHub Actions
   secret (not in source) and baked into the JS bundle at build time. Joe
   generates it once from `/connect`'s "Generate Invite Link" button,
   copies just the `code=` value, and adds it as the repo secret
   `PUBLIC_GAME_INVITE_CODE`. Regenerate only if the underlying PAT is
   rotated. The code is visible in the deployed JS bundle (the browser
   needs it to build the link), but it's kept out of the git history.

### Section 4: Host your own world

Step-by-step tutorial with external links that open in new tabs:

1. **Fork the template** — link to `https://github.com/CYOAGame/ironhaven`,
   click "Fork" on GitHub.
2. **Create a fine-grained PAT** — link to
   `https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new?description=Journal+RPG`.
   Lists required permissions:
   - Contents: Read and write
   - Metadata: Read (default)
   - Pull requests: Read and write
3. **Connect to the game** — link to `{base}/setup`. Paste the PAT, select
   the fork repo, connect.
4. **Invite friends** — from the Connect page, click "Generate Invite Link"
   and share it. Friends click the link, pick a name, and play — no GitHub
   account needed.

### Section 5: Footer

- "Already set up? Go to Setup" → `{base}/setup`
- "Play Offline" → `{base}/?offline=true`

### Error banner

When the URL has `?error=invite-expired`, show a banner at the top:
*"Your invite link has expired or was revoked. Ask the world owner for a
new one."*

This is the redirect target for invite-code users whose token expires
mid-session.

## OAuth removal

### Delete entirely

**OAuth artifacts:**

| Path | What it was |
|---|---|
| `tools/oauth-worker.js` | Cloudflare Worker for OAuth token exchange |
| `tools/wrangler.toml` | Worker deployment config |
| `tools/README.md` | OAuth App + Worker setup instructions |
| `.env.example` | Documented `PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` + `PUBLIC_OAUTH_WORKER_URL` |
| `.env` | Local OAuth config (gitignored) |
| `src/routes/login/+page.svelte` | The login page (OAuth button + PAT link) |

**Join-request system (dead code — replaced by invite-code model):**

With invite links as the sharing mechanism, players never need to be
GitHub collaborators. The host's token (embedded in the invite link) is
what grants repo access. The entire join-request approval system is
therefore unnecessary.

| Path | What it was |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/invites/invite-client.ts` | `listJoinRequests`, `approveJoinRequest`, `denyJoinRequest` |
| `src/lib/invites/invite-url.ts` | `buildJoinRequestUrl` for pre-filled GitHub Issues |
| `src/lib/components/InvitesBadge.svelte` | Badge showing pending invite count during gameplay |
| `tests/invites/invite-client.test.ts` | Tests for the join-request orchestration |
| `tests/invites/invite-url.test.ts` | Tests for the issue URL builder |
| `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-11-owner-approved-invites.md` | The join-request feature spec |
| `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-11-owner-approved-invites.md` | The join-request implementation plan |

**Remove from files (join-request cleanup):**

- `src/lib/git/github-client.ts` — remove `addCollaborator` function
- `tests/git/github-client.test.ts` — remove `addCollaborator` tests
- `src/routes/connect/+page.svelte` — remove Pending Invites section,
  InvitesBadge import, "Not a collaborator yet" panel, "Invite a Player"
  form, `pollInvites`/`handleApprove`/`startDeny`/`confirmDeny`/
  `handleDirectInvite` functions and their state variables
- `src/routes/journal/+page.svelte` — remove `<InvitesBadge />` drop-in
- `src/routes/session-end/+page.svelte` — remove `<InvitesBadge />` drop-in
- `src/routes/timeline/+page.svelte` — remove `<InvitesBadge />` drop-in
- `src/routes/login/pat-wizard/+page.svelte` (becoming `/setup`) — remove
  the optional "Administration: Read and write" bullet from permissions list

### Rename

| From | To |
|---|---|
| `src/routes/login/pat-wizard/+page.svelte` | `src/routes/setup/+page.svelte` |
| `src/routes/login/pat-wizard/wizard-state.ts` | `src/routes/setup/wizard-state.ts` |
| `tests/routes/pat-wizard-state.test.ts` | `tests/routes/setup-wizard-state.test.ts` |

Update all imports and internal references after the rename.

### Modify

**`src/lib/stores/github.ts`**
- `AuthMethod` type: remove `'oauth'`. Becomes `'pat' | 'invite-code' | null`.

**`src/routes/connect/+page.svelte`**
- Remove the `authMethod === 'pat'` gate on Create World. PAT is now the
  only host auth method — the gate is always true. Keep the "Create World
  requires forking on GitHub" message since a scoped PAT still can't fork
  via the API, but remove the authMethod check.
- Remove any reference to OAuth in error messages or fallback copy.

**`src/routes/session-end/+page.svelte`**
- Change the `AuthExpiredError` redirect from `/login?error=expired` to
  a branch:
  ```typescript
  if ($githubState.authMethod === 'pat') {
      goto(`${base}/setup?error=expired`);
  } else {
      // invite-code user
      goto(`${base}/?error=invite-expired`);
  }
  ```

**All other files that redirect to `/login?error=expired`**
- Same branching pattern: `connect/+page.svelte` catch blocks,
  `routes/+page.svelte` (which is now the landing page and no longer does
  auth checks — the expired redirect lands here via the query param).

**`src/routes/setup/+page.svelte`** (the renamed wizard)
- Handle `?error=expired` query param: show a banner at the top of step 1
  saying *"Your PAT expired or was revoked. Please create a new one and
  reconnect."*
- Update all internal `{base}/login` references to `{base}/setup`.
- Update the "Back to login" footer link to "Back to home" → `{base}/`.

**`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**
- Remove `PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `PUBLIC_OAUTH_WORKER_URL` from the
  build `env:` block.
- Add `PUBLIC_GAME_INVITE_CODE: ${{ secrets.PUBLIC_GAME_INVITE_CODE }}`
  to the build `env:` block (replaces the two OAuth vars with one invite
  var).

### Don't delete (Joe handles manually, out-of-band)

- The deployed Cloudflare Worker — `wrangler delete` when ready
- The GitHub OAuth App under CYOAGame org — delete from org settings
- The GitHub Actions secrets — delete from repo settings

## Testing

### Automated

- Existing tests should still pass after the rename (update import paths
  in `tests/routes/setup-wizard-state.test.ts`).
- No new unit tests needed — the landing page is static content, and the
  wizard logic is unchanged (just moved).

### Manual checklist

- [ ] Landing page renders at `/` with all 5 sections
- [ ] "Play Offline" link works (existing flow)
- [ ] "Join the Public World" link opens `/invite?code=...` with the
      hardcoded code, validates, shows the name-entry form
- [ ] "Host your own world" links all open correct github.com pages
- [ ] `/setup` renders the PAT wizard (same behavior as old `/login/pat-wizard`)
- [ ] `/login` returns 404 (deleted)
- [ ] Token expiry for a host mid-session → redirects to `/setup?error=expired`
      with the banner visible
- [ ] Token expiry for an invite-code player mid-session → redirects to
      `/?error=invite-expired` with the banner visible
- [ ] Full test suite passes
- [ ] `npm run check` shows no new errors

## Out of scope

- Fancy landing page animations or illustrations — plain styled content
  matching the existing dark journal aesthetic
- Blog/changelog section
- Custom domain setup
- Analytics
